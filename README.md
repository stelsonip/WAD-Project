# Namibia Recipe Book — Project Proposal

## 2. Introduction & Background

This project is a plan to build a web application for a client based on the project **"Namibia Recipe Book"**.

Namibia has a rich culinary heritage, but many traditional recipes for local foods such as *kapana* and *mopane worms* are passed down orally and are not readily accessible online.  
The objective of this project is to address this issue by creating a dedicated digital platform for Namibian recipes.
